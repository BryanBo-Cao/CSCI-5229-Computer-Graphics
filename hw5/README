Write an OpenGL program that incorporates lighting to create a a scene
consisting of solid objects that can be viewed in three dimensions under user
control.

The purpose of this homework is to give you experience with determening normal
vectors which are critical in performing the lighting calculations.  Therefore
the follow are not permitted:
1) Any GLU and GLUT objects;
2) Pyramids;
3) Objects constructed entirely of calls to my cube or sphere functions;
4) Objects created by Blender or a similar program and imported to the program.

You may use the CSCIx229 library for this and future assignments, but remember
to include all the source files with your submission and built the library from
source in your makefile.

The light should move to demonstrate changes to the scene as a result of
different light positions.  It will be useful for both debugging and grading
if the light can be stopped and moved under user control in addition to moving
automatically.  Choose your light positions such that the lighting effects are
demonstrated well.

What to turn in:
1) Source code, makefile to build hw5 and readme;
2) Approximate time spent on the project.

Hint:  Trust your instincts.  If the lighting doesn't look right, it porbably
is not.  A common error is incorrect normals.

WARNING:  Getting lighting to work correctly is hard.  Expect this homework to
take a lot more effort than previous assignments.




### To make: 
Open Terminal or Terminator on Ubuntu, cd to the 'hw5' directory, you will see both the "hw5.c" and "makefile", enter command "make".

### To run this program:
Open Terminal or Terminator on Ubuntu, after "make" process, cd to the the 'hw5' directory and enter command "./hw5". Or simply double click the exe file named "hw5" in the Files.

Create an OpenGL program this allows a scene to be viewed in 3D . The program
should allow the scene to be viewed from multiple eye positions directed by
user input.

The scene should consist of several 3D solid objects, and at least two
instances of the same object, but with each instance at a different position,
scale and orientation. The program must create at least one generic object, and
then create each instance by translation, rotation and scaling of the generic
object.
